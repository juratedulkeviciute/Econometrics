#### First assignment for Practical Econometrics II course.

This assignment shows how to plot a boxplot in R. The script is based on "swirl" lessons.

R generates 15 numbers between 1 and 20, with an ability to repeat.

``` {r}
numb<-sample(1:20,15,replace=TRUE)
```

The content of numb.
```{r}
numb
```

R draws a boxplot, color of boxplot is going to be light blue.

```{r} 
boxplot(numb, col="lightblue")
```

Also we can look at some characteristics of numb.
```{r}
summary(numb)
```
